C<REST::Google> provides OO interface to Google REST (aka AJAX) API.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item __PACKAGE__->service()

Get/set service to use. You must set this to valid URL. E.g.:

	REST::Google->service('http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/web');

=item __PACKAGE__->http_referer()

Get/set HTTP C<Referer> header.

	REST::Google->http_referer('http://example.org/search.html');

I<Note:> Google says that you should supply a valid HTTP referer header each time you
perform a request to their AJAX API, so C<new()> raises warning unless referer is specified.

=item __PACKAGE__->new()

The constructor use it's arguments to build a valid HTTP GET request to given service,
so it takes the same arguments as the given web service takes.
Please refer to 'Google AJAX API' documentation for complete list
of arguments for a service you're using. E.g.:

	my $res = REST::Google->new(
		q => 'Pamela Anderson',
	);

For example, if you're using the Web search service, the code above will perform a following HTTP GET request:

	http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/web?q=Pamela+Anderson&v=1.0

I<Note:> You can left protocol version number unspecified since C<v=1.0> is passed by default.

and has the following structure:

	{
		"responseData" => {},
		"responseDetails" => undef | string-on-error,
		"responseStatus" => 200 | error-code
	}

=item $res->responseStatus()

The responseStatus property contains a value of 200 on success and a non-200
HTTP error status code on failure. If there is a failure, C<responseDetails> contains
a diagnostic string.

=item $res->responseDetails()
